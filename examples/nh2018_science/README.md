## Demo script for the analyses done in Nakamura and Huang (2018, Science)

The jupyter notebook `demo_script_for_nh2018.ipynb` is a complimentary demo script that can 
be used to reproduce data required in the analyses done in

Nakamura and Huang, Atmospheric Blocking as a Traffic Jam in the Jet Stream. Science. (2018)

This notebook demonstrates how to compute local wave activity (LWA), LWA flux and flux con/divergence 
in equations (2) and (3) in NH2018 with the updated functionality in the python package `hn2016_falwa` 
(version 0.3.1 and after).

To set up the environment to run the scripts, create an environment with `example/environment.yml`:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To run the script, clone the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa) and install 
the package with
```
python setup.py install
```

The sample data can be downloaded with the script `download_example.py`, given that you have 
the python package `ecmwfapi` installed and have an account on ECMWF server.

The functionalities are enhanced and included in the class object `QGField` under 
`hn2016_falwa.oopinterface`. Please refer to the [documentation](http://hn2016-falwa.readthedocs.io/) (search `QGField`) 
for the input/methods this class provides.
